	abstract = {Protecting the kernel of an operating system against attacks, especially injection of malicious code, is an important factor for implementing secure operating systems. Several kernel integrity protection mechanism were proposed recently that all have a particular shortcoming: They cannot protect against attacks in which the attacker re-uses existing code within the kernel to perform malicious computations. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system that fully automates the process of constructing instruction sequences that can be used by an attacker for malicious computations. We evaluate the system on different commodity operating systems and show the portability and universality of our approach. Finally, we describe the implementation of a practical attack that can bypass existing kernel integrity protection mechanisms.},

	shorttitle = {Moving Target Defense Strategy in Critical Embedded Systems},
	abstract = {Moving Target Defense ({MTD}) is a promising de-fense technique that aims to break the asymmetry between attacker and defender by reconfiguring a system's assets. When used in a critical embedded system, non-functional constraints limit the set of usable {MTD} techniques, therefore limiting the entropy of reconfigurations. It is therefore necessary to compute an optimal moving target strategy in order to reduce the time between reconfigurations, while managing their impact on the quality of service provided to users. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach to define an optimal moving target defense strategy. Our approach translates risk analysis parame-ters into a Bayesian Stackelberg game, which we translate to a mixed integer linear program. We validate our approach on an industrial case study from the automotive domain, showing the practical usability of our approach. In further experiments, we assess the scalability of our method, as well as the solution's stability in case new vulnerabilities are discovered after the deployment of the system.},

The framework of Markov games allows us to widen this view to include multiple adaptive agents with interacting or competing goals. This paper considers a step in this direction in which exactly two agents with diametrically opposed goals share an environment. It describes a Q-learning-like algorithm for ﬁnding optimal policies and demonstrates its application to a simple two-player game in which the optimal policy is probabilistic.},

Moving target defense ({MTD}) is a cyberdefense paradigm, successfully implemented in conventional systems, that could improve {IoT} security. Objective: Identify and synthesize existing {MTD} techniques for {IoT} and validate the feasibility of {MTD} as a cybersecurity paradigm suitable for {IoT} systems. Method: We use a systematic literature review method to search and analyze existing {MTD} for {IoT} techniques up to July 2020. We evaluated the existing techniques in terms of security foundations and realworld deployability using the evidence they provide. We deﬁne and use entropy-related metrics to categorize them. This is the ﬁrst {MTD} survey to use Shannon’s entropy metric empirically. Results: Thirty-two distinct {MTD} for {IoT} techniques exist: 54\% are Network-layer-based, 50\% present strong evidence about their real-world deployment, and 64\% have weak security foundations. Conclusion: {MTD} for {IoT} is a feasible cyberdefense approach. A variety of proposals exist, with evidence about their implementation and evaluation. Nevertheless, the {MTD} for {IoT} state of the art is still immature: the security foundations of most existing proposals are weak. Novel techniques should prioritize providing convincing security foundations and real-world deployment evidence.},

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

This paper provides a survey of the recent works that utilized the Q-Learning algorithm in terms of security enabling and privacy-preserving. Different adoption of Q-Learning for security and defending strategies are studied.

	title = {Nash Q-Learning for General-Sum Stochastic Games},
	abstract = {We extend Q-learning to a noncooperative multiagent context, using the framework of generalsum stochastic games. A learning agent maintains Q-functions over joint actions, and performs updates based on assuming Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. This learning protocol provably converges given certain restrictions on the stage games (deﬁned by Q-values) that arise during learning. Experiments with a pair of two-player grid games suggest that such restrictions on the game structure are not necessarily required. Stage games encountered during learning in both grid environments violate the conditions. However, learning consistently converges in the ﬁrst grid game, which has a unique equilibrium Q-function, but sometimes fails to converge in the second, which has three different equilibrium Q-functions. In a comparison of ofﬂine learning performance in both games, we ﬁnd agents are more likely to reach a joint optimal path with Nash Q-learning than with a single-agent Q-learning method. When at least one agent adopts Nash Q-learning, the performance of both agents is better than using single-agent Q-learning. We have also implemented an online version of Nash Q-learning that balances exploration with exploitation, yielding improved performance.},

abstract = {In a class of games known as Stackelberg games, one agent (the leader) must commit
to a strategy that can be observed by the other agent (the follower or adversary)
before the adversary chooses its own strategy. We consider Bayesian Stackelberg games,
in which the leader is uncertain about the types of adversary it may face. Such games
are important in security domains, where, for example, a security agent (leader) must
commit to a strategy of patrolling certain areas, and a robber (follower) has a chance
to observe this strategy over time before choosing its own strategy of where to attack.
This paper presents an efficient exact algorithm for finding the optimal strategy
for the leader to commit to in these games. This algorithm, DOBSS, is based on a novel
and compact mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Compared to the most efficient
algorithm known previously for this problem, DOBSS is not only faster, but also leads
to higher quality solutions, and does not suffer from problems of infeasibility that
were faced by this previous algorithm. Note that DOBSS is at the heart of the ARMOR
system that is currently being tested for security scheduling at the Los Angeles International
Airport.},

 abstract = {A number of papers have shown that a strict Nash equilibrium action profile of a game may never be played if there is a small amount of incomplete information (see, for example, Carlsson and van Damme (1993a)). We present a general approach to analyzing the robustness of equilibria to a small amount of incomplete information. A Nash equilibrium of a complete information game is said to be robust to incomplete information if every incomplete information game with payoffs almost always given by the complete information game has an equilibrium which generates behavior close to the Nash equilibrium. We show that many games with strict equilibria have no robust equilibrium and examine why we get such different results from existing refinements. If a game has a unique correlated equilibrium, it is robust. A natural many-player many-action generalization of risk dominance is a sufficient condition for robustness.},

The Bluetooth probe penetration rate analysis is the first and necessary step for assessment of Bluetooth as traffic flow data collection technology in the area of interest. In this paper we bring field measurement, raw data processing, and filtering with robust filters for detecting outliers in vehicle detection using Bluetooth signal as a marker. In accordance with the reviewed literature, obtained results show that Bluetooth probe penetration rate in the City of Zagreb is sufficient for some {ITS} applications, and it is stable throughout the week.},

	abstract = {Bluetooth {MAC} Address matching has become a useful approach for determining travel times on corridors in the United States. In September 2013, an international collaborative study was performed using this technology along a busy urban corridor in Chennai, India. Two Purdue University graduate students traveled to Chennai, India to interact and understand the dynamics of exchanging knowledge and implementing technologies in different environments. The students worked with students from {IIT} Madras to determine the feasibility of Bluetooth probe vehicle technology along a typical Indian corridor. The study determined that it is feasible to expand Bluetooth use in India. Using the technology, the impact of weather, holiday and peak hour related traffic events were determined and evaluated. Of particular note were the relative high penetration of Bluetooth devices, and the exceptionally strong impact of precipitation on the heterogeneous traffic stream in Chennai, India.},

	abstract = {Moving-target defenses ({MTDs}) have been widely studied for common general-purpose and enterprise-computing applications. Indeed, such work has produced highly effective, low-overhead defenses that are now commonly deployed in many systems today. One application space that has seen comparatively little focus is that of safety- and mission-critical systems, which are often realtime systems ({RTS}) with temporal requirements. Furthermore, such systems are increasingly being targeted by attackers, such as in industrial control systems ({ICS}), including power grids. The strict timing requirements of these systems presents a different design objective than is common in general-purpose applications – systems should be designed around the worst-case performance, rather than the average case. Perhaps in part due to these alternative design considerations, many real-time systems have not benefited from much of the work on software security that common general-purpose and enterprise applications have, despite the ubiquity of real-time systems that actively control so many applications we as a society have come to rely on, from power generation and distribution, to automotive and avionic applications, and many others.},

Our model can incorporate various information structures. In this work, we focus on the worst-case scenario from the defender's perspective where the attacker can observe the previous configurations used by the defender. This is a reasonable assumption especially when the attacker is sophisticated and persistent. By formulating the defender's problem as a Markov Decision Process ({MDP}), we prove that the optimal switching strategy has a simple structure and derive an efficient value iteration algorithm to solve the {MDP}. We further study the case where the set of feasible switches can be modeled as a regular graph, where we solve the optimal strategy in an explicit way and derive various insights about how the node degree, graph size, and switching cost affect the {MTD} strategy. These observations are further verified on random graphs empirically.},

Previous works on {MTD}, however, mainly focus on deciding the sequence of system conﬁgurations to be used and have largely ignored the equally important timing problem. Given that both the migration cost and attack time vary over system conﬁgurations, it is crucial to jointly optimize the spatial and temporal decisions in {MTD} to better protect the system from persistent threats. In this work, we propose a Stackelberg game model for {MTD} where the defender commits to a joint migration and timing strategy to cope with conﬁguration-dependent migration cost and attack time distribution. The defender’s problem is formulated as a semi-Markovian decision process and a nearly optimal {MTD} strategy is derived by exploiting the unique structure of the game.},

	abstract = {The present complexity in designing web applications makes software security a diﬃcult goal to achieve. An attacker can explore a deployed service on the web and attack at his/her own leisure. Moving Target Defense ({MTD}) in web applications is an eﬀective mechanism to nullify this advantage of their reconnaissance but the framework demands a good switching strategy when switching between multiple conﬁgurations for its web-stack. To address this issue, we propose the modeling of a real world {MTD} web application as a repeated Bayesian game. We formulate an optimization problem that generates an eﬀective switching strategy while considering the cost of switching between diﬀerent web-stack conﬁgurations. To use this model for a developed {MTD} system, we develop an automated system for generating attack sets of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ({CVEs}) for input attacker types with predeﬁned capabilities. Our framework obtains realistic reward values for the players (defenders and attackers) in this game by using security domain expertise on {CVEs} obtained from the National Vulnerability Database ({NVD}). We also address the issue of prioritizing vulnerabilities that when ﬁxed, improves the security of the {MTD} system. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of our proposed model by evaluating its performance when there is uncertainty about input attacker information.},

	abstract = {With the evolution of the research on network moving target defense ({MTD}), the selection of optimal strategy has become one of the key problems in current research. Directed to the problem of the improper defensive strategy selection caused by inaccurately characterizing the attack and defense game in {MTD}, optimal strategy selection for {MTD} based on Markov game ({MG}) is proposed to balance the hopping defensive revenue and network service quality. On the one hand, traditional matrix game structure often fails to describe {MTD} confrontation accurately. To deal with this inaccuracy, {MTD} based on {MG} is constructed. Markov decision process is used to characterize the transition among network multi-states. Dynamic game is used to characterize the multi-phases of attack and defense in {MTD} circumstances. Besides, it converts all the attack and defense actions into the changes in attack surface or the ones in exploration surface, thus improving the universality of the proposed model. On the other hand, traditional models care little about defense cost in the process of optimal strategy selection. After comprehensively analyzing the impact of defense cost and defense benefit on the strategy selection, an optimal strategy selection algorithm is designed to prevent the deviation of the selected strategies from actual network conditions, thus ensuring the correctness of optimal strategy selection. Finally, the simulation and the deduction of the proposed approach are given in case study so as to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy optimal selection approach.},

Adopting moving target defense ({MTD}) helps thwart cyber attacks by continuously changing the attack surface.

Security models, such as an attack graph ({AG}), provide a formal method of analyzing the security, but incorporating {MTD} techniques in those security models has not been studied. In this paper, we incorporate {MTD} techniques into a security model, namely a hierarchical attack representation model ({HARM}), to assess the effectiveness of them. In addition, we use importance measures ({IMs}) for deploying {MTD} techniques to enhance the scalability. Finally, we compare the scalability of {AG} and {HARM} when deploying {MTD} techniques, as well as changes in performance and security in our experiments.},

Attack trees are inherently static and limited to independent events, whereas {BDMP} are dynamic and can take into account simple dependences. This allows the modeling of attack sequences, but also of defensive aspects such as detections. Petri net-based approaches are highly flexible but often lack readability and scalability; {BDMP} representations are close to attack trees, inheriting their readability and easy appropriation. Moreover, {BDMP} have mathematical properties leading to drastic reductions of combinatorial problems, allowing efficient scenarios processing and time dependent quantifications.

In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment. We also show how our game theoretical framework can be applied to conﬁgure the intrusion detection strategies in realistic scenarios via a case study. Finally, we evaluate the proposed game theoretical framework via simulations. The simulation results show both the correctness of the analytical results and the effectiveness of the proposed guidelines.},

Very, very simple. But as vehicles have evolved over time, so has the electrical architecture. Jump ahead to 2018 where the car needs to transfer 15,000 pieces of data in the blink of an eye. Within just a couple of years, by 2020, that will jump to 100,000 pieces of data. Consumer demand for safety and software-enabled features is increasing at an unprecedented rate. This increase in software-enabled capability impacts infotainment, user experience, active safety and connected vehicle services, and paves the way for the ultimate application, autonomous driving.As the demand for software-enabled features grows, there is a corresponding increase in the need for computing horsepower. Just like the latest iPhone has to add more computing power to run all the new apps, we need to add more computing horsepower to the car to run all the latest features.What this means is that the traditional architecture approach will no longer be viable and support the growth in content and complexity. There isn’t enough computing power to run the vehicle’s complex software algorithms, and the networking infrastructure cannot support the data transfer speeds of the future.A closer look at how electrical architecture systems have evolved over the decades helps explain this remarkable increase—and why the automotive world is shifting from a fragmented approach to the future… a software-defined digital platform.1950s: Simplicity Minimal Electrical Content, No Electronics12-volt systems reignRing terminals = primary connection method56/58/59 connections make their debutWoven cloth coverings are standard 1960s: Stability Electrical Content GrowsAudio and lighting enhancements spur content growthGlass fuse protections becomes standard

More features means more computing power, more data and more power distribution than ever before. And as the car becomes a supercomputer, with more and more features and connectivity, its architecture or foundation needs to change radically. The historical vehicle architecture approach no longer works – it can’t support the growth in content and complexity.This is where Aptiv’s expertise in smart architectures comes in. Aptiv’s Smart Vehicle Architecture™ (SVA) incorporates the full suite of our technology and brings it together through our systems integration expertise. We are unique in that we can integrate whole systems through SVA™, which enable all the electrification, active safety, automation, and connectivity, driving this new mobility.We focus our efforts in four key areas; software, sensing and compute platforms, data and power distribution and connected services – all of which are foundational elements of Aptiv’s smart vehicle architecture.What does this mean for autonomous driving? We can deliver an integrated vehicle system that controls each critical task needed to achieve higher levels of autonomy. Autonomous driving requires Automotive Safety Integrity Level D for fail-safe operation. This drives an electrical architecture break, and with it, deep implications on each of the three critical system levels: Power Distribution, Networking and Compute.Aptiv’s smart vehicle architecture has a three-layer fail operational design. This approach to system design considers power failure, network failure and even compute failure. It also has the ability to dynamically re-route power, network traffic and even decision making to bring an autonomous car to a safe stop. Our extensive system design expertise covering all three layers delivers the necessary IP for fail-safe operation, the foundation for any smart vehicle architecture.Learn more about Aptiv’s smart vehicle architecture at aptiv.com/SVA View our Smart Vehicle Architecture page},

Therefore, ﬁnding the optimal distribution of security resources to protect the network is necessary. In this paper, we focus on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are among the main components used to secure networks. However, conﬁguring and deploying IDSs eﬃciently to optimize attack detection and mitigation remain a challenging task. In particular, in networks providing critical services, optimal IDS deployment depends on the type of interdependencies that exists between vulnerable network equipment. In this paper, we present a game theoretical analysis for optimizing intrusion detection in such networks. First, we present a set of theoretical preliminary results for resource constrained network security games. Then, we formulate the problem of intrusion detection as a resource constrained network security game where interdependencies between equipment vulnerabilities are taken into account. Finally, we validate our model numerically via a real world case study.},

Numerous related works involving several facets of MTD have been published. However, comprehensive analyses and research on MTD are still absent. In this paper, we present a survey on MTD technologies to scientiﬁcally and systematically introduce, categorize, and summarize the existing research works in this ﬁeld. First, a new security model is introduced to describe the changes in the traditional defense paradigm and security model caused by the introduction of MTD. A function-and-movement model is provided to give a panoramic overview on diﬀerent perspectives for understanding the existing MTD research works. Then a systematic interpretation of published literature is presented to describe the state of the art of the three main areas in the MTD ﬁeld, namely, MTD theory, MTD strategy, and MTD evaluation. Speciﬁcally, in the area of MTD strategy, the common characteristics shared by the MTD strategies to improve system security and eﬀectiveness are identiﬁed and extrapolated. Thereafter, the methods to implement these characteristics are concluded. Moreover, the MTD strategies are classiﬁed into three types according to their speciﬁc goals, and the necessary and suﬃcient conditions of each type to create eﬀective MTD strategies are then summarized, which are typically one or more of the aforementioned characteristics. Finally, we provide a number of observations for the future direction in this ﬁeld, which can be helpful for subsequent researchers.},

Decoy defenses can be further enhanced by randomizing the space of node IP addresses, thus preventing an adversary from identifying and blacklisting decoy nodes over time. The decoy-based defense results in a time-varying interaction between the adversary, who attempts to identify and target real nodes, and the system, which deploys decoys and randomizes the address space in order to protect the identity of the real node. In this paper, we present a gametheoretic framework for modeling the strategic interaction between an external adversary and a network of decoy nodes. Our framework consists of two components. First, we model and study the interaction between the adversary and a single decoy node. We analyze the case where the adversary attempts to identify decoy nodes by examining the timing of node responses, as well as the case where the adversary identiﬁes decoys via diﬀerences in protocol implementations between decoy and real nodes. Second, we formulate games with an adversary who attempts to ﬁnd a real node in a network consisting of real and decoy nodes, where the time to detect whether a node is real or a decoy is derived from the equilibria of the games in ﬁrst component. We derive the optimal policy of the system to randomize the IP address space in order to avoid detection of the real node, and prove that there is a unique threshold-based Stackelberg equilibrium for the game. Through simulation study, we ﬁnd that the game between a single decoy and an adversary mounting timingbased attacks has a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, while identiﬁcation of decoy nodes via protocol implementation admits only mixed-strategy equilibria.},

	title = {Effectiveness of {IP} address randomization in decoy-based moving target defense},
	abstract = {In a decoy-based moving target defense (MTD), a computer network introduces a large number of virtual decoy nodes in order to prevent the adversary from locating and targeting real nodes. Since the decoys can eventually be identified and their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses blacklisted by the adversary, current MTD approaches suggest that the IP addresses of the real and decoy nodes should be randomly refreshed and reassigned over time. Refreshing and reassigning the IP addresses, however, disrupts services such as TCP/IP that rely on the IP address. We introduce an analytical approach to MTD and choosing the optimal randomization policy in order to minimize disruptions to system performance. Our approach consists of two components. First, we model the interaction between the adversary and a virtual node as a sequential detection process, in which the adversary attempts to determine whether the node is real or a decoy in the minimum possible time. We compute the optimal strategy for the adversary to decide whether the node is real or a decoy, and derive closed-form expressions for the expected time to identify the real node using this strategy. Second, we formulate the problem of deciding when to randomize the IP addresses, based on a trade-off between reducing the probability of detecting the real node and minimizing the disruption to network services, as an optimal stopping problem. We derive the optimal randomization policy for the network and analyze the detection probability, expected number of connections lost due to IP randomization, and expected time between randomizations under the proposed policy. Our results are illustrated via a simulation study using real-world data from NMAP, a software tool used to identify decoy nodes. Our simulation study indicates that our IP randomization policy reduces the probability of detection while minimizing the number of connections that are disrupted by the randomization.},

In this paper, we present Meltdown. Meltdown exploits side effects of out-of-order execution on modern processors to read arbitrary kernel-memory locations including personal data and passwords. Out-of-order execution is an indispensable performance feature and present in a wide range of modern processors. The attack is independent of the operating system, and it does not rely on any software vulnerabilities. Meltdown breaks all security guarantees provided by address space isolation as well as paravirtualized environments and, thus, every security mechanism building upon this foundation. On affected systems, Meltdown enables an adversary to read memory of other processes or virtual machines in the cloud without any permissions or privileges, affecting millions of customers and virtually every user of a personal computer. We show that the KAISER defense mechanism for KASLR has the important (but inadvertent) side effect of impeding Meltdown. We stress that KAISER must be deployed immediately to prevent largescale exploitation of this severe information leakage.},

Whereas defenders must protect a large, diverse set of cybersystems containing an unknown number of vulnerabilities of various types, attackers need only find one or a few exploitable vulnerabilities to mount a successful attack. One promising approach that can shift the balance in the defenders' favor is to create uncertainty for attackers by dynamically changing system properties in what is called a cyber moving target (MT). MT techniques seek to randomize system components to reduce the likelihood of a successful attack, add dynamics to a system to reduce the lifetime of an attack, and diversify otherwise homogeneous collections of systems to limit the damage of a large-scale attack. In this article, the authors review the five dominant domains of MT techniques available today as research prototypes and commercial solutions.

	abstract = {Security at major locations of economic or political importance is a key concern around the world, particularly given the threat of terrorism. Limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times, which allows adversaries to observe and exploit patterns in selective patrolling or monitoring, e.g. they can plan an attack avoiding existing patrols. Hence, randomized patrolling or monitoring is important, but randomization must provide distinct weights to different actions based on their complex costs and benefits. To this end, this paper describes a promising transition of the latest in multi-agent algorithms into a deployed application. In particular, it describes a software assistant agent called {ARMOR} (Assistant for Randomized Monitoring over Routes) that casts this patrolling/monitoring problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game, allowing the agent to appropriately weigh the different actions in randomization, as well as uncertainty over adversary types. {ARMOR} combines two key features: (i) It uses the fastest known solver for Bayesian Stackelberg games called {DOBSS}, where the dominant mixed strategies enable randomization; (ii) Its mixed-initiative based interface allows users to occasionally adjust or override the automated schedule based on their local constraints. {ARMOR} has been successfully deployed since August 2007 at the Los Angeles International Airport ({LAX}) to randomize checkpoints on the roadways entering the airport and canine patrol routes within the airport terminals. This paper examines the information, design choices, challenges, and evaluation that went into designing {ARMOR}.},

	title = {An Efﬁcient Heuristic Approach for Security Against Multiple Adversaries},
	abstract = {In adversarial multiagent domains, security, commonly deﬁned as the ability to deal with intentional threats from other agents, is a critical issue. This paper focuses on domains where these threats come from unknown adversaries. These domains can be modeled as Bayesian games; much work has been done on ﬁnding equilibria for such games. However, it is often the case in multiagent security domains that one agent can commit to a mixed strategy which its adversaries observe before choosing their own strategies. In this case, the agent can maximize reward by ﬁnding an optimal strategy, without requiring equilibrium. Previous work has shown this problem of optimal strategy selection to be {NP}-hard. Therefore, we present a heuristic called {ASAP}, with three key advantages to address the problem. First, {ASAP} searches for the highest-reward strategy, rather than a Bayes-Nash equilibrium, allowing it to ﬁnd feasible strategies that exploit the natural ﬁrst-mover advantage of the game. Second, it provides strategies which are simple to understand, represent, and implement. Third, it operates directly on the compact, Bayesian game representation, without requiring conversion to normal form. We provide an efﬁcient Mixed Integer Linear Program ({MILP}) implementation for {ASAP}, along with experimental results illustrating signiﬁcant speedups and higher rewards over other approaches.},

Mixed-integer program ({MIP}) problem is one where some of the decision variables are constrained to be integer values. {MILP} involves problems in which only some variables are constrained to be integers, while other variables can be non-integers. It deals with linear objective function subjected to linear constraints. Minimisation and maximisation of a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear constraints with continuous and discrete variables are performed by {MINLP} solution methods. In this paper, the recent {MILP} and {MINLP} solution methods, algorithms along with solvers and software, introduced by various researchers has bee n elaborated profoundly.},

	abstract = {Security at major locations of economic or political importance is a key concern around the world, particularly given the threat of terrorism. Limited security resources prevent full security coverage at all times, which allows adversaries to observe and exploit patterns in selective patrolling or monitoring, e.g. they can plan an attack avoiding existing patrols. Hence, randomized patrolling or monitoring is important, but randomization must provide distinct weights to different actions based on their complex costs and beneﬁts. To this end, this paper describes a promising transition of the latest in multi-agent algorithms – in fact, an algorithm that represents a culmination of research presented at {AAMAS} – into a deployed application. In particular, it describes a software assistant agent called {ARMOR} (Assistant for Randomized Monitoring over Routes) that casts this patrolling/monitoring problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game, allowing the agent to appropriately weigh the different actions in randomization, as well as uncertainty over adversary types. {ARMOR} combines three key features: (i) It uses the fastest known solver for Bayesian Stackelberg games called {DOBSS}, where the dominant mixed strategies enable randomization; (ii) Its mixed-initiative based interface allows users to occasionally adjust or override the automated schedule based on their local constraints; (iii) It alerts the users if mixed-initiative overrides appear to degrade the overall desired randomization. {ARMOR} has been successfully deployed since August 2007 at the Los Angeles International Airport ({LAX}) to randomize checkpoints on the roadways entering the airport and canine patrol routes within the airport terminals. This paper examines the information, design choices, challenges, and evaluation that went into designing {ARMOR}.},

	abstract = {The paper develops a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information where the players are uncertain about some important parameters of the game situation, such as the payoff functions, the strategies available to various players, the information other players have about the game, etc. However, each player has a subjective probability distribution over the alternative possibilities.

In most of the paper it is assumed that these probability distributions entertained by the different players are mutually “consistent”, in the sense that they can be regarded as conditional probability distributions derived from a certain “basic probability distribution” over the parameters unknown to the various players. But later the theory is extended also to cases where the different players' subjective probability distributions fail to satisfy this consistency assumption.

In cases where the consistency assumption holds, the original game can be replaced by a game where nature first conducts a lottery in accordance with the basic probability distribution, and the outcome of this lottery will decide which particular subgame will be played, i.e., what the actual values of the relevant parameters will be in the game. Yet, each player will receive only partial information about the outcome of the lottery, and about the values of these parameters. However, every player will know the “basic probability distribution” governing the lottery. Thus, technically, the resulting game will be a game with complete information. It is called the Bayes-equivalent of the original game. Part I of the paper describes the basic model and discusses various intuitive interpretations for the latter. Part II shows that the Nash equilibrium points of the Bayes-equivalent game yield “Bayesian equilibrium points” for the original game. Finally, Part III considers the main properties of the “basic probability distribution”.},

We have implemented our strategies as new functionality in the software tool CAESAIR [1].

CPS must thus be built with a high degree of resilience to mitigate threats that security cannot alleviate.

The ARES methodology pursues cyber security and resilience (CSR) as high level system properties to be developed in the context of the mission.

Its designers aimed it primarily at a client–server model and it provides mutual authentication—both the user and the server verify each other's identity.

Kerberos builds on symmetric key cryptography and requires a trusted third party, and optionally may use public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication. Kerberos uses UDP port 88 by default.},

With these IP addresses come new security threats as attackers may attempt to attack a whole family of objects. This problem becomes even more worrying when considering safety critical objects (i.e. their failures can have catastrophic consequences). In this paper we propose a Moving Target Defense (MTD) technique at the network level, that consists in reassigning objects’ IP addresses in order to escape from attackers both outside or inside the object’s subnetwork. We propose different variants of this defense allowing for a trade-off between (i) increasing the security level, and (ii) lowering the network load overhead due to the defense. As opposed to existing works, we also define a method to maintain the objects’ connectivity while reassigning IP addresses. A motivating example from the automotive domain is used to illustrate the applicability of this work.},

Unfortunately, protecting software against attacks is a long-lasting endeavor that is still under active research. However, certain software-hardening schemes are already incorporated into current compilers and are actively used to make software exploitation a complicated procedure for the adversaries. Stack canaries are such a protection mechanism. Stack canaries aim to prevent control ﬂow hijack by detecting corruption of a speciﬁc value on the program’s stack. Careful design and implementation of this conceptually straightforward mechanism is crucial to defeat stack-based control ﬂow detours. In this paper, we examine 17 diﬀerent stack canary implementations across multiple versions of the most popular Operating Systems running on various architectures. We systematically compare critical implementation details and introduce one new generic attack vector which allows bypassing stack canaries on current Linux systems running up-to-date multi-threaded software altogether. We release an open-source framework (CookieCrumbler ) that identiﬁes the characteristics of stack canaries on any platform it is compiled on and we propose mitigation techniques against stack-based attacks. Although stack canaries may appear obsolete, we show that when they are used correctly, they can prevent intrusions which even the more sophisticated solutions may potentially fail to block.},

The security and privacy implications of such in-car networks, however, have are not well understood as their transmissions propagate beyond the conﬁnes of a car’s body. To understand the risks associated with these wireless systems, this paper presents a privacy and security evaluation of wireless Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems using both laboratory experiments with isolated tire pressure sensor modules and experiments with a complete vehicle system. We show that eavesdropping is easily possible at a distance of roughly 40m from a passing vehicle. Further, reverse-engineering of the underlying protocols revealed static 32 bit identiﬁers and that messages can be easily triggered remotely, which raises privacy concerns as vehicles can be tracked through these identiﬁers. Further, current protocols do not employ authentication and vehicle implementations do not perform basic input validation, thereby allowing for remote spooﬁng of sensor messages. We validated this experimentally by triggering tire pressure warning messages in a moving vehicle from a customized software radio attack platform located in a nearby vehicle. Finally, the paper concludes with a set of recommendations for improving the privacy and security of tire pressure monitoring systems and other forthcoming in-car wireless sensor networks.},

To demonstrate the effectiveness of fuzzing USB device drivers, we present our prototypical implementation of a mutation-based, man-in-the-middle USB fuzzing framework based on an emulated environment. We practically applied our framework to fuzz the communication between an Apple iPod device and a WindowsXP system. This way, we found several potential vulnerabilities. This supports our claim that the USB architecture exposes real attack vectors and should be considered when assessing the physical security of computer systems in the future.},

In this paper, we propose MOTAG, a moving target defense mechanism that secures service access for authenticated clients against flooding DDoS attacks. MOTAG employs a group of dynamic packet indirection proxies to relay data traffic between legitimate clients and the protected servers. Our design can effectively inhibit external attackers' attempts to directly bombard the network infrastructure. As a result, attackers will have to collude with malicious insiders in locating secret proxies and then initiating attacks. However, MOTAG can isolate insider attacks from innocent clients by continuously "moving" secret proxies to new network locations while shuffling client-to-proxy assignments. We develop a greedy shuffling algorithm to minimize the number of proxy re- allocations (shuffles) while maximizing attack isolation. Simulations are used to investigate MOTAG's effectiveness on protecting services of different scales against intensified DDoS attacks.},

abstract="Moving target defenses have been proposed as a way to make it much more difficult for an attacker to exploit a vulnerable system by changing aspects of that system to present attackers with a varying attack surface. The hope is that constructing a successful exploit requires analyzing properties of the system, and that in the time it takes an attacker to learn those properties and construct the exploit, the system will have changed enough by the time the attacker can launch the exploit to disrupt the exploit's functionality. This is a promising and appealing idea, but its security impact is not yet clearly understood. In this chapter, we argue that the actual benefits of the moving target approach are in fact often much less significant than one would expect. We present a model for thinking about dynamic diversity defenses, analyze the security properties of a few example defenses and attacks, and identify scenarios where moving target defenses are and are not effective.",

	abstract = {Using Software-defined Networks in wide area (SDN-WAN) has been strongly emerging in the past years. Due to scalability and economical reasons, SDN-WAN mostly uses an in-band control mechanism, which implies that control and data sharing the same critical physical links. However, the in-band control and centralized control architecture can be exploited by attackers to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) on SDN control plane by flooding the shared links and/or the Open flow agents. Therefore, constructing a resilient software designed network requires dynamic isolation and distribution of the control flow to minimize damage and significantly increase attack cost. Existing solutions fall short to address this challenge because they require expensive extra dedicated resources or changes in OpenFlow protocol. In this paper, we propose a moving target technique called REsilient COntrol Network architecture (ReCON) that uses the same SDN network resources to defend SDN control plane dynamically against the DDoS attacks. ReCON essentially, (1) minimizes the sharing of critical resources among data and control traffic, and (2) elastically increases the limited capacity of the software control agents on-demand by dynamically using the under-utilized resources from within the same SDN network. To implement a practical solution, we formalize ReCON as a constraints satisfaction problem using Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) to guarantee a correct-by-construction control plan placement that can handle dynamic network conditions.},

This framework bases on three pillars: network address mutation, communication stack randomization and the dynamic deployment of decoys. The network address mutation is based on the concept of domain generation algorithms, where different features are included to fulfill the system requirements. Those requirements are time dependency, unpredictability and determinism. Communication stack randomization is applied additionally to increase the complexity of reconnaissance activity. By employing communication stack randomization, previously fingerprinted systems do not only differ in the network address but also in their communication pattern behavior. And finally, decoys are integrated into the proposed framework to detect attackers that have breached the perimeter. Furthermore, attacker’s resources can be bound by interacting with the decoy systems. Additionally, the framework can be extended with more advanced Moving Target Defense methods such as obscuring port numbers of services.},

Extensive research has been devoted to the development of cryptographic algorithms that provide the theoretical underpinnings of information security. Functional security mechanisms, such as security protocols, suitably employ these mathematical primitives in order to achieve the desired security objectives. However, functional security mechanisms alone cannot ensure security, since most embedded systems present attackers with an abundance of opportunities to observe or interfere with their implementation, and hence to compromise their theoretical strength. This paper surveys various tamper or attack techniques, and explains how they can be used to undermine or weaken security functions in embedded systems. Tamper-resistant design refers to the process of designing a system architecture and implementation that is resistant to such attacks. We outline approaches that have been proposed to design tamper-resistant embedded systems, with examples drawn from recent commercial products.},

The overall security of a network cannot be determined by simply counting the number of vulnerabilities. To accurately assess the security of networked systems, one must understand how vulnerabilities can be combined to stage an attack. We model such composition of vulnerabilities through attack graphs. By simulating incremental network penetration, and propagating attack likelihoods, we measure the overall security of a networked system. From this, we score risk mitigation options in terms of maximizing security and minimizing cost. We populate our attack graph models from live network scans and databases that have knowledge about properties such as vulnerability likelihood, impact, severity, and ease of exploitation. Our ﬂexible model can be used to quantify overall security of networked systems, and to study cost/beneﬁt tradeoﬀs for analyzing return on security investment.},

One promising approach that can shift the balance in the defenders' favor is to create uncertainty for attackers by dynamically changing system properties in what is called a cyber moving target (MT). MT techniques seek to randomize system components to reduce the likelihood of a successful attack, add dynamics to a system to reduce the lifetime of an attack, and diversify otherwise homogeneous collections of systems to limit the damage of a large-scale attack. In this article, the authors review the five dominant domains of MT techniques available today as research prototypes and commercial solutions.

However there has been little work to study how much proactively changing a network’s conﬁguration can increase the difﬁculty for attackers and thus improve the resilience of the system under attack. In this paper we present a basic design schema of a movingtarget network defense system. Based on this design schema, we conducted a simulation-based study to investigate the degree to which proactively changing a network’s various parameters can decrease an adversary’s chance for success. We believe this is an important ﬁrst step towards understanding why and how the concept of a moving target can be successfully applied to computer network defenses.},

Adopting moving target defense (MTD) helps thwart cyber attacks by continuously changing the attack surface. There are numerous MTD techniques proposed in various domains (e.g., virtualized network, wireless sensor network), but there is still a lack of methods to assess and compare the effectiveness of them. Security models, such as an attack graph (AG), provide a formal method of analyzing the security, but incorporating MTD techniques in those security models has not been studied. In this paper, we incorporate MTD techniques into a security model, namely a hierarchical attack representation model (HARM), to assess the effectiveness of them. In addition, we use importance measures (IMs) for deploying MTD techniques to enhance the scalability. Finally, we compare the scalability of AG and HARM when deploying MTD techniques, as well as changes in performance and security in our experiments.},

	abstract = {The static nature of cyber systems gives attackers the advantage of time. Fortunately, a new approach, called the Moving Target Defense (MTD) has emerged as a potential solution to this problem. While promising, there is currently little research to show that MTD systems can work eﬀectively in real systems. In fact, there is no standard deﬁnition of what an MTD is, what is meant by attack surface, or metrics to deﬁne the eﬀectiveness of such systems. In this paper, we propose an initial theory that will begin to answer some of those questions. The paper deﬁnes the key concepts required to formally talk about MTD systems and their basic properties. It also discusses three essential problems of MTD systems, which include the MTD Problem (or how to select the next system conﬁguration), the Adaptation Selection Problem, and the Timing Problem. We then formalize the MTD Entropy Hypothesis, which states that the greater the entropy of the system’s conﬁguration, the more eﬀective the MTD system.},

Within the proposed framework we deﬁne the concept of security capacity which measures the strength or eﬀectiveness of an MTD strategy: the security capacity depends on MTD speciﬁc parameters and more general system parameters.

Existing techniques often lack the capacity to perform a comprehensive and exhaustive analysis on complex redundant architectures, leading to less than optimal risk evaluation. This paper addresses these weaknesses by 1) proposing a new probabilistic modeling of Fault Tree gates and their composition as Markov Decision Processes; 2) developing a new formal-based technique to perform an in-depth verification of the system's reliability. This technique makes use of the expressiveness of fault trees and the power of probabilistic model checking in order to investigate the best Triple Modular Redundancy partitioning and configuration of a system. The presented approach greatly improves the overall scalability with respect to other techniques, while also improving the accuracy of the results. For example, we can provide probabilistic failure rates for a chain of 100 redundant components in little over one second.},

	doi = {10.1109/CDC.2013.6759960},
	abstract = {In a decoy-based moving target defense (MTD), a computer network introduces a large number of virtual decoy nodes in order to prevent the adversary from locating and targeting real nodes. Since the decoys can eventually be identified and their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses blacklisted by the adversary, current MTD approaches suggest that the IP addresses of the real and decoy nodes should be randomly refreshed and reassigned over time. Refreshing and reassigning the IP addresses, however, disrupts services such as TCP/IP that rely on the IP address. We introduce an analytical approach to MTD and choosing the optimal randomization policy in order to minimize disruptions to system performance. Our approach consists of two components. First, we model the interaction between the adversary and a virtual node as a sequential detection process, in which the adversary attempts to determine whether the node is real or a decoy in the minimum possible time. We compute the optimal strategy for the adversary to decide whether the node is real or a decoy, and derive closed-form expressions for the expected time to identify the real node using this strategy. Second, we formulate the problem of deciding when to randomize the IP addresses, based on a trade-off between reducing the probability of detecting the real node and minimizing the disruption to network services, as an optimal stopping problem. We derive the optimal randomization policy for the network and analyze the detection probability, expected number of connections lost due to IP randomization, and expected time between randomizations under the proposed policy. Our results are illustrated via a simulation study using real-world data from NMAP, a software tool used to identify decoy nodes. Our simulation study indicates that our IP randomization policy reduces the probability of detection while minimizing the number of connections that are disrupted by the randomization.},
